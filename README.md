Hi !👋My name is Varenium Setia
========================================================================================================================================

I am a Master of Science in Business Analytics having **3 years** of experience in the **analytics** industry. I have worked on pricing, forecasting and post sales revenue analytics. As part of the practicum project at UC Davis, I engaged with the VP of analytics and the analytics team at **Engage3** as a **Data Scientist**. I, along with my team were successful in creating a price validation feature for Engage3's price prediction module using Machine Learning techniques, which in turn helped the clients to take informed decisions. 

Previously, I held the role of a Decision Analytics Associate at **ZS Associates** which is one of the largest consulting firms in the world. There, I implemented data models and was part of analytical projects, identifying sales trends and the driving factors behind those.

My impactful professional experience is backed by a strong academic foundation, with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from **Punjab Engineering College**, and **Masters in Business Analytics** from **UC Davis**. I am determined to contribute my expertise in driving business growth and solving critical challenges in the field of analytics.
